**Dataset Selection and Justification**

Data Set Used: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/austinreese/craigslist-carstrucks-data/data

For the midterm project I selected the Used Cars Dataset: Vehicles listings from Craigslist.org from Kaggle by Austin Reese as my data set (Kaggle URL: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/austinreese/craigslist-carstrucks-data). The collection methodology utilized was data scraped from Craigslist.com which was originally updated quarterly and was last updated four years ago. I selected this specific data set because I freelance with an automotive ad agency that works with car dealerships that sell large volumes of used vehicles. The data allows me to understand the competitive landscape and see which vehicles are being posted and at which price point. I am able to see manufacturer, price, condition - albeit very biased by the personal opinion of the poster – and the states with the most used vehicles for sale by owner. The agency works with dealerships across the United States, so it provides insights into which states have higher volumes of used cars listed for sale help clients understand the popular manufacturers and if vehicle on the lot are prices are too high. Some manufacturers may be more popular than others, allowing us to customize ads to highlight popular vehicles and understand local demand to better inform our ad targeting. As the agency signs new dealerships, pulling and analyzing this data at the start of a campaign would be beneficial so the strategy developed resonates immediately with an audience. There are known limitations to using this data set - some columns are very sparsely filled (lots of missing values in fields like “size”, “drive”, etc.). Another limitation is this data is a snapshot over a limited period, and craigslist has continuously changed posts. Because the dataset is based solely on what sellers’ input, there is potential for human error, typos, or intentional misreporting.

**Data Quality Assessment and Documentation**

First, I imported my libraries into the Jupyter Notebook, I used df.head() to look an the data headers, then df.shape to quickly determine the number of rows and columns in the data. df.columns allowed me to see all the column names, and I examined the number of completed rows and df.describe() and df.types to get a pulse check on the information that might be included. To quickly verify the accuracy of the information in the data set, I calculated the number of states, which was all 51 (all 50 states plus D.C.). 

Next, I needed to see the missing values by creating a table of the percentage of missing data, with "county" missing from 100% of the posts. The second highest column with missing values was "size" with 71% missing. I wanted to visualize the missing values by creating a heat map, which is did with matplot to see any patterns in the missing data. I determined based off the percentage of missing values, the columns county, size, cylinders, condition, vin, drive, paint_color and type have the largest amount of missing data and can be removed from further analysis, leaving eighteen columns to work on. There was a concerning number of missing variables in the remaining columns, with manufacturers missing from 4% of the data, which was suprisingly high. Price and state were present for all the rows so that data would be available. 

**Comprehensive Data Cleaning**

To begin cleaning the data, I first determined the categorical field sizes for each column, I expected columns like url, VIN, and other unique fields to be very large. There were 42 different manufacturers and 29,649 different models. This large amount of model data led me to utilize manufacturers going forward with the data analysis and visualization. Then I began a step-by-step process to identify and extract rows that contain missing values, created a Boolean mask DataFrame with each cell becoming true or false and used the Boolean mask to filter the original DataFrame to return rows that contain missing data in any column. 
I then performed df.drop to remove the columns I determined earlier that had too many missing values (columns county, size, cylinders, condition, vin, drive, paint_color and type), I repulled the columns to ensure the ones I no longer needed were removed going forward. I pulled a simple state valuations chart and bar chart to see if the visualizations looked appropriate with the cleaned data. I learned by doing this exercise that plotly.express interactive visualizations do not convert to github, so the second chart I created of total vehicle prices by state did not display properly. 


**Strategic Feature Engineering**

I wanted to examine the manufacturer data amd the sum of prices for each brand listed, with the total combined value of all Toyota listings is about $8.0 billion for the entire United States during the period of time this data was being pulled. Toyota, Chevrolet, and Mercedes-Benz lead by a large margin, which could indicate a high number of listings or in the case of Mercedes, a higher price point. Luxury brands rank higher due to price points vs. volumne of listings that could occur with Ford or Chevrolet. Discontinued brands like Saturn and Mercury are at the bottom as expected. I will be cautious in case some vehicle prices were incorrectly listed - example for 100,000 or 1,000,000 instead of 10,000. 

**Thorough Exploratory Data Analysis**

To double check this, I pulled the manufacturer data with the count of each, showing how many vehicles of each brand appear on Craigslist during this time. At the top now is Ford with 70,985 vehicles listed. Ford and Chevrolet are the top in volume of listings as they are affordable brands. Mercedes-Benz, BMW, and Toyota dominate in total value — fewer listings but higher prices per unit. This could indicate that the Toyota brand holds value longer than similar competitors, aligning their resell price point closer to that of a used luxury vehicle. An anomaly is Volvo - the brand is number 5 in sum of price but falls to number 24 in number of vehicles listed. The Volvo brand resell value tends to be on average with other luxury brands so I would want to examine this further at a later date. Finally, I created a chart to show the car manufacturer vs the average price and the data appears skewed by incorrectly input prices by the seller. The average cost of a Mercedes-Benz is showing as $513,710 and Volvo as $383,755, and surprisingly Toyota, Jeep and Chevrolet look to have incorrect sale prices inflating that average price amount.
